Scriptname COB Hidden
{CHIM OStim Bridge by SaurOff - CHIM's direct entry point for the bridge's actions.
 For a command "ExtCmd<Name>_<Action>" CHIM first calls <Name>.DispatchExternalCommand,
 the way it hands commands to other CHIM plugins; without such a script it falls back to
 the "CHIM_CommandReceived" mod event, a path on which CHIM's command queue broke after the
 first action of a session. This only forwards the command to COB_Bridge through the
 bridge's own mod event, so CHIM's queue is never held up while a scene is being set up.}
